# Assignment 2 // Adrianna Deeb

**Description**

This is a script to make a number of toruses in Maya, and save the scene as a Maya ASCII file.


**Agruments**

It takes an integer corresponding to the number of toruses the user wants to be created in Maya.
After the creation of the toruses, it will prompt the user to enter a file name to save the scene as a Maya ASCII file (.ma)

**Example**

When testing, I successfully ran this script in the VSCode terminal. It looked like this:
```
PS C:\Users\adria\code\anim-t380-2022-assignments\assignment-2> & "C:\Program Files\Autodesk\Maya2023\bin\mayapy.exe" c:/Users/adria/code/anim-t380-2022-assignments/assignment-2/python/main.py 2
Creating 2 torus(es)...
Qt WebEngine seems to be initialized from a plugin. Please set Qt::AA_ShareOpenGLContexts using QCoreApplication::setAttribute before constructing QGuiApplication.
Created Torus #0
Created Torus #1
Meshes in the Maya scene: ['pTorusShape1', 'pTorusShape2']
Name the Maya file to save: test
```
For me, the file saved to the default project folder. I opened it and it did have two toruses inside.

Enjoy!
